Tower Defense Game
Overview
Tower Defense Game is a strategic defense game built using Python and Pygame, where players must strategically place towers to defend against waves of enemies. The game features a simple yet engaging gameplay loop, allowing players to experience the thrill of defending their territory while managing resources and upgrading defenses.

Features
Dynamic Enemy Movement: Enemies follow a predefined path and move towards the goal, providing a challenge as they attempt to breach your defenses.
Tower Placement: Players can place towers at strategic locations to shoot at incoming enemies. Each tower has a specific range and cooldown period.
Bullet Mechanics: Towers shoot bullets towards enemies, dealing damage upon impact. Bullets are visually represented and move towards their targets.
Health System: Enemies have health points that decrease when hit by bullets. Once their health reaches zero, they are removed from the game.
Path Visualization: The path that enemies follow is clearly marked, allowing players to plan their tower placements effectively.
Gameplay
Players can place towers at designated locations to defend against waves of enemies.
Each tower has a cooldown period before it can shoot again, requiring players to think strategically about their placements.
As enemies are defeated, new ones spawn at regular intervals, increasing the challenge.
The game continues until an enemy reaches the end of the path, at which point the player loses.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for game development.
Pygame: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, providing functionalities for graphics, sound, and game mechanics.
